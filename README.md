# Human Stress Detection in and through Sleep

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project detects **stress levels** in humans during sleep using **physiological data** collected from **IoT-based devices**. It uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset with features like **snoring rate**, **respiration rate**, **body temperature**, and **heart rate**.

The data comes from Kaggle and the **SaYoPillow** project, an IoT-based smart pillow that monitors sleep and helps detect stress. The aim is to assist users in understanding and managing stress for improved **health and well-being**.

## ðŸ§© Problem Description

The project predicts **stress levels** based on sleep cycle data. Stress is detected using features like **heart rate**, **limb movement**, and **snoring rate**, and is categorized into **five levels** ranging from **low to high**.

The system aims to improve sleep quality and offer personalized stress tracking insights.

|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Snoring Rate**      | Intensity of snoring during sleep                 |
| **Respiration Rate**  | Frequency of breathing during sleep               |
| **Body Temperature**  | Body temperature while sleeping                   |
| **Limb Movement**     | Frequency of limb movements during sleep          |
| **Blood Oxygen**      | Blood oxygen levels during sleep                  |
| **Eye Movement**      | Ocular activity during sleep                      |
| **Sleeping Hours**    | Total number of hours of sleep                    |
| **Heart Rate**        | Heart rate during sleep                           |
